  # Finally, note that the "Warning" from wilcox.test was just that:
  # a warning rather than an indication that your results are incorrect.
  # The test was OK, reporting a p-value based on a normal approximation
  # rather than an exact p-value based on the data values. If you had 50
  # or more cases, your call to wilcox.test would not even have tried to
  # calculate exact p-values. The coin package in R has a wilcox_test
  # function that can calculate exact p-values in the presence of ties,
  # but I see no need here for an exact p-value.
